// You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

// Examples
// [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
// Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

// [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
// Should return: 160 (the only even number)

function findOutlier(integers) {
  const oddNumbers = integers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);
  const evenNumbers = integers.filter((number) => number % 2 !== 0);

  return oddNumbers.length === 1 ? oddNumbers[0] : evenNumbers[0];
}

console.log(findOutlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]));
console.log(findOutlier([160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]));
